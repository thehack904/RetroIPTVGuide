# RetroIPTVGuide
RetroIPTVGuide is a Flask-based IPTV web interface inspired by 90s/2000s cable TV guides. It displays channel lineups from .m3u playlists and program data from XMLTV EPGs in a nostalgic grid. Features include user authentication, admin controls, and HLS playback, making it perfect for ErsatzTV or any IPTV source.
